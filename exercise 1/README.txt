Exercise 1 - Movie Trailer Website
Version 2.0
---------------------------------

This application generates a movie trailer web page where users can view 
trailors for the alien trilogy. 

The zip folder contains the following files.
-------------------------------------------

 1 - e1_movie_page_generator.py
     This contains three instances of a movie class. Each instance has a 
     title, trailor, and poster.

 2 - fresh_tomatoes_mod.py
     This file generates the HTML file based off of the movie instances in
     e1_movie_page_generator.py. It is a slightly modified version of the 
     fresh_tomatoes.py file provided by Udacity.

 3 - fresh_tomatoes.hmtl
     This is the HTML file generated by fres_tomatoes_mod.py. You can open 
     this file in your browser of choice to view the trailors.

 4 - README.txt
     This is me. I am the README.txt file.

How to run the application
--------------------------
Python version 2.7.10 or later must be installed on your machine. Python 
version 3 may be used, but is not guaranteed to work.

1 - In terminal/cmd, navigate to the directory where the files are located.
2 - Run the command line Python e1_movie_page_generator.py

Once executed, the application will generate an HTML file names 
fresh_tomatoes.html which will be opened by your default web browser.

The generated web page contains posters of each movie in the original Alien
trilogy. Click anywhere on the poster tile to watch the trailor.
